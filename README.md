# Data Analytics and Visualisation using Pluto.jl Notebooks

This is a working Pluto notebook running using the Julia programming language.

The function of this repo is as a collection of useful code snippets I found very handy during processing of large datasets on supercomputers.

The beginning of the notebook looks something like this:

And with a slider, we can easily take a slice _and_ visualize the turbulent fields. Neat!
